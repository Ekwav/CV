## Project sumary
The [skyblock project](https://sky.coflnet.com) started with data archiving for the in game auction house. 
Together with two friends I built an auction explorer on top of it.  
Since then we extended the service with various analytics options of the in game market.
Besides storing all auctions that are created we also archive the prices of the bazaar in the game as well as direct trades of users.

### About Skyblock
Skyblock is so called [MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) on the [Hypixel Minecraft Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypixel).
It has an in game economy with two market places. One is for auctions the other one is called bazaar and acts like a stock market with two order books.
