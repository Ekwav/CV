## Project sumary
Grab Your Items allows users to add new items at their current location with images and description to be picked up by anyone else for free.
Intended use case is that users don't have to throw away items that someone else could want/need.  
Project was made in the second year of my education.


## Tech Stack 
* angular.io
* leaflet.s for maps
* java backend (implemented by project partner)
